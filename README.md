We will start by setting up the HTML structure, where we'll define the layout and elements required for the quiz. Then, we'll move on to designing the user interface using CSS, making the application visually appealing and engaging.

Next, we'll dive into the JavaScript implementation, where we'll handle the logic behind displaying questions, capturing user responses, and calculating the score. JavaScript will be the backbone of our quiz application, allowing us to dynamically generate content, validate user inputs, and provide interactive feedback.
